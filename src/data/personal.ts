    bio: {
        short: `Machine Learning Engineer building production AI systems at Wipro. I specialize in GenAI agents, RAG architectures, and computer vision—turning business problems into deployed solutions. M.Sc. Data Science from CMI. Previously reduced support costs 40% with an intelligent agent system at Coriolis, and shipped a 95%+ mAP crack detection pipeline at AlgoLabs. Passionate about making AI reliable enough for production.`,

        long: `I'm a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in production GenAI and computer vision systems. Currently at Wipro, I build enterprise AI solutions—from intelligent document processing pipelines to multi-agent orchestration systems that automate complex business workflows.

My approach combines strong statistical foundations (M.Sc. Data Science from CMI, CGPA 8.31) with hands-on engineering experience shipping real systems. At AlgoLabs, I built and deployed a computer vision pipeline for infrastructure monitoring (95%+ mAP). At Coriolis, I developed an agentic AI assistant that reduced support team workload by 40% through intelligent workflow automation.

I'm obsessed with building AI systems that actually work in production—which means focusing on reliability, evaluation, and maintainability, not just model performance. My ideal next role is at a company that's serious about putting cutting-edge AI into production at scale.`,
