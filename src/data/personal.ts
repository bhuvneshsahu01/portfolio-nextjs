    bio: {
        short: `Data Scientist at Wipro developing Agentic AI systems, Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) solutions, and proprietary Computer Vision models. Strong background in Statistics with expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and production AI systems.`,

        long: `I am Bhuvnesh Sahu, a Data Scientist at Wipro, where I develop Agentic AI systems, 
           Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) solutions, and proprietary Computer Vision models at 
           enterprise scale. With a strong academic foundation in Statistics (B.Sc from Hindu College, 
           Delhi University) and currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science from Chennai Mathematical 
           Institute, I bridge the gap between theoretical machine learning and production-ready AI systems.

           My professional journey includes building system-agnostic AI assistants at Coriolis Technologies 
           and developing industrial-grade crack detection systems at AlgoLabs. I focus on creating solutions 
           that translate messy business problems into structured analytical pipelines, comfortable with both 
           classical statistical modeling and cutting-edge deep learning/LLM workflows.

           I am particularly skilled at building, evaluating, optimizing, and deploying models that solve 
           real-world challenges, with hands-on experience in Agentic AI, Gen-AI, Computer Vision, NLP, 
           and end-to-end MLOps pipelines.`,
